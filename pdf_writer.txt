Intro to PDF Writer 
===================

The PDF Writer consists of a package, PDF_Out,
which produces PDF files - as "physical" files, or as
other types of data streams.
The creation of an PDF file is as simple as this
small procedure:

  with PDF_Out; use PDF_Out;
   
  procedure Small_demo is 
    pdf: PDF_Out_File;
  begin 
    pdf.Create("Small.pdf");
    pdf.Put_Line("Hello world !");
    pdf.Close;
  end;

Warning & legal
===============
There is NO WARRANTY in this software. Read copyright notice in pdf_out.ads.

Portability
===========
This software can be compiled for any target machine, and with any Ada 95 or later compiler.

How to build PDF Writer and its demo
====================================
Here is how to build with GNAT/GCC:

    - type "gprbuild -P pdf_out_gnat" in the command line
or
    - open the pdf_out_gnat.gpr file (will launch the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)),
      press F4 (Build)

Here is how to build with ObjectAda (7.2.2):
    - open the pdf_out_oa.prj file, press F7 (Build)

As a result there is a pdf_out_demo[.exe] executable.
  
Type hierarchy
==============
In PDF_Out:

  |- PDF_Out_Stream  : root type, abstract
  \
   |- PDF_Out_File   : type for writing to files (defined in PDF_Out)
   |- PDF_Out_String : type for writing to strings (defined in PDF_Out)
   |
In your own extension, if needed:
   |
   |- (your own stream!)

How to create properly PDF files or streams
===========================================
Most, if not all possibilities are in the Big_demo procedure
nested in PDF_Out_Demo. So it is a good place to pick code...

To summarize, you need to define the document contents in
a certain order:

1. Create

2. Optional settings, before any output or next page:
   | Define page layout (see Header, Footer, Page_Setup, ...)
   | Font, Font_Size, ...

3. | Put(pdf, data),
   | New_Line(pdf), ... : other "Text_IO"-like (full list below)
   | New_Page(pdf)

4. Close

5. (PDF_Out_String only) function Contents returns the full .pdf

As you observed, you can write cell contents by setting for each cell
the target row and column, with Write, or by using Put,
Put_Line, New_Line, just like Ada.Text_IO. Both ways can be mixed
ad libitum.

Enjoy!
