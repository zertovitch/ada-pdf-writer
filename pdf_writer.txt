Intro to PDF Writer 
===================

The PDF Writer consists of a package, PDF_Out,
which produces PDF files - as "physical" files, or as
other types of data streams.

The creation of a PDF file is as simple as this
small procedure (Ada 2005+ object-oriented syntax):

  with PDF_Out; use PDF_Out;
   
  procedure Small_demo is 
    pdf: PDF_Out_File;
  begin 
    pdf.Create("Small.pdf");
    pdf.Put_Line("Hello world !");
    pdf.Close;
  end;

  - gid/*              : packages used by pdf_out.adb (this is the Generic Image Decoder)

Warning & legal
===============
There is NO WARRANTY in this software. Read copyright notice in pdf_out.ads.

Portability
===========
This software can be compiled for any target machine, and with any compiler
for Ada 95 or later language versions.

How to build PDF Writer and its demo
====================================
Here is how to build with GNAT/GCC:

    - type "gprbuild -p -P pdf_out_gnat" in the command line
or
    - open the pdf_out_gnat.gpr file (will launch the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)),
      press F4 (Build)

Here is how to build with ObjectAda (tested with v.7.2.2):
    - open the pdf_out_oa.prj file, press F7 (Build)

As a result there is a pdf_out_demo[.exe] executable.
  
Type hierarchy
==============
In PDF_Out:

  |- PDF_Out_Stream  : root type, abstract
  \
   |- PDF_Out_File   : type for writing to files (defined in PDF_Out)
   |- PDF_Out_String : type for writing to strings (defined in PDF_Out)
   |
In your own extension, if needed:
   |
   |- (your own stream!)

How to create properly PDF files or streams
===========================================
Most, if not all possibilities are in the Big_demo procedure
nested in PDF_Out_Demo. So it is a good place to pick code...

To summarize, you need to define the document contents in
a certain order:

1. Create

2. Optional settings, before any output or next page:
   | Define page layout (see Header, Footer, Page_Setup, ...)
   | Font, Font_Size, ...

3. | Put(pdf, data),
   | New_Line(pdf), ... : other "Text_IO"-like (full list below)
   | Image(pdf, ...)    : raster images
   | Move/Line/...      : vector graphics
   | New_Page(pdf)

4. Close

5. (PDF_Out_String only) function Contents returns the full .pdf
